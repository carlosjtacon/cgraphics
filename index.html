        <h2>Development and Programming Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I have worked on multiple projects both personal and related to university studies. You can check out my
            <a href="https://github.com/carlosjtacon" target="_blank">personal GitHub page</a> where the source code of
            some projects is available for free. 
        </p>

        <p>Some featured projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Morfilms:</b> I made this app to keep track of films I wanted to watch when they got released in theaters. 
                I ended up publishing it in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.morfilms.watchlist" target="_blank">Android - Google Play</a> and 
                <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/morfilms-upcoming-movies-list/id1207671266?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS - App Store.</a>
                Source code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/carlosjtacon/morfilms" target="_blank">in this repo.</a> 
                I developed morfilms using web technology: Angular and Ionic Framework.

            <li>
                <b>Showtimes API:</b> Before making morfilms I was already interested on ways to handle cinema and movies related data in order to make mobile apps. 
                I made an API to store and offer showtimes info by city, location services for cinemas and information about movies, getting information from various providers. 
                It's deprecated now, but its <a href="https://github.com/carlosjtacon/showtimes-api" target="_blank">source code is still available.</a> Made with Java/Spring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>University Projects:</b> I also have published university activities and projects, some of them are interesting for you to check out my programming skills. For example I developed 
                <a href="https://github.com/carlosjtacon/uni-algorithm-design-paradigms" target="_blank">some known algorithms in python</a> to learn new algorithm design paradigms:
                divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and backtracking.
            </li>
        </ul>
